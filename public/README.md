# Nick Peihl's Resume

This is my resume. It uses the [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org) schema with the [resume-cli](http://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) library to create my resume.

The formatted resume is based on the [Short](http://themes.jsonresume.org/theme/short) JSON Resume theme by [Graeme Maciver](http://www.graememaciver.com/).
